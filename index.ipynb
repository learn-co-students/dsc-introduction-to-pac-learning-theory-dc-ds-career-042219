    "\n",
    "**Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)** computational learning theory provides a mathematically rigorous definition of statistical machine learning in a computational environment. This forms the basis of what we call \"Machine Learning\" (ML).\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have looked at the steps required to run simple machine learning algorithms including data representations, feature selection and engineering, training, prediction and loss calculation. In this lesson, we shall provide a brief overview of a __Probably Approximately Correct__ or __PAC__ learning theory that provides a theoretical foundation for experimental settings that we have seen in previous sections. **In essence , PAC deals with the computational aspect of machine learning**. The theory helps us anticipate the required levels of sample complexity and associated computational complexity in order to answer an analytical question. "

    "## Intuition behind PAC\n",
    "\n",
    "> The PAC is a learning models which is characterized by __learning from examples__. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can formulate a basic learning framework from given examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, consider $f$ as the target function to be __learnt__, the __learner__ (the computational model) is provided with some random examples in the form :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(X,f(X))$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $X$ is a binary input instance of length $n$, and $f(X)$ is the value (boolean TRUE or FALSE) of the target function at that instance. So in essence, we are being provided with a number of input examples and a target output specifying weather the input is a positive or negative. Any binary classification problem can fit this scenario ranging from disease identification, customer retention to results of a game of sports (win/lose). \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these examples, the __learner must succeed__ in calculating the target function $f$ which is expressed  as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f : [0, 1]^n → {0, 1}$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we actually mean by __success__ here?  It should actually be any measure or a series of evaluation steps that help us find that the __algorithm meets the experimental criteria__. Hence this approach can be shown using the model below:"

    "Probably approximately correct (PAC) learning theory helps analyze whether and under what conditions a learner $L$ will **probably** output an **approximately correct** classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's define the \"approximate\" aspect of this theory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> A hypothesis $h∈H$ is **approximately correct** if its error over the distribution over inputs $D$ is bounded by some error $\\epsilon$ , such that  $0 \\le \\epsilon \\le \\frac{1}{2}.$ \n",

    "\n",
    "![](pac.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the equation shown above i.e. $m \\ge\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}(ln|H| + ln\\frac{1}{\\delta})$, note the effects on $m$ when we alter variables in the right-hand side. \n",
    "\n",
    "As allowable error $\\epsilon$ decreases, the necessary sample size $m$ grows. i.e. a higher number of samples will be required to conclude an experiment with a low margin of error. sample size grows with the probability of an approximately correct learner, and with the size of the hypothesis space $H$. \n",

One obvious reason could be that learning examples do not fully reflect the probability distribution that the examples belong to. This hinders learning process seriously and target function $f$ can not be successfully achieved. insufficient examples is something that we come across very often in machine learning discipline.  PAC Learning attempts to reduce the probability of getting poor examples by __considering a sufficient number of examples__ for learning the required function. "

So we expect the learner to find a function $h$ which is very close to the desired function $f$. So we say that __$h$ approximates $f$__ , and that is the function we are interested in learning. \n",

We have seen that machine learning experiments start with some data, $(x_i,y_i)$ and we want to find a hypothesis (or a model) that will, given the inputs $x_i$ return $y_i$ or something very close. More importantly given new data $x̃$  the model will  predict the corresponding $ỹ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model that was created using some (out of many examples) of data do not accurately reflect that data set, but can be accurate on any future data sets. The two important points are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- We cannot predict new data with 100% accuracy.\n",
    "- There is always a possibility that the one or more examples are poor and do not explain much. \n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "So that is PAC. It is essentially provides theoretical and mathematical underpinning to different stages of machine learning that we have been looking at in our course. This theory justifies the need for splitting data into test and training sets. It gives a reason to tune hyper parameters as the learner is independent of the data distribution. This theory also provides grounds for the evaluation methods we have seen including RMSE, ROC, AUC etc. to ensure that our model is learning and approximating a desired function. "
